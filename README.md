# hello-world
Description: This is my first repository, for ideas, resources, and discussion items.

My experience is mostly with Oracle SQL queries at work, but a full history includes...

- Oracle SQL queries: I've built Oracle SQL queries for years at my job, though I've never written my own full PL/SQL script that includes things like explicitly scripting how an entirely text-based delimited result is formatted. Instead, I've always opted to stick with SELECT statements, and export the results to Excel. I have very strong skills in joining reporting warehouse data that has been fairly denormalized, and also, when necessary, going straight to the more normalized source data and joining a dozen or more tables.

- RDBMS: A very basic understanding of how relational database models should be structured.

- C# (implemented in Unity): At home, I've experimented with learning C# via building small, incomplete games in the Unity game engine. I would like to finish at least one small game and add it to my portfolio.

- C++: I studied C++ for a few weeks and played around with it, I'm not familiar enough to build a finished product on my own. It's August 2021 now, and it's been a few years since I played around with it, maybe in mid-2018.

- JavaScript: I studied JavaScript around the same time I was studying C++ for a few weeks (see above), and again, I'm not familiar enough yet to build a finished product on my own.

- Python: I've just started learning Python, as it's used quite a bit by analytical staff at my job, and I've also heard it's a common choice for creating all kinds of applications with clear, explicit code that anybody can read.

I have a partner and a dog, and I love to play music, sing, and work on home improvement stuff with my partner. That's about all it takes to know me!
